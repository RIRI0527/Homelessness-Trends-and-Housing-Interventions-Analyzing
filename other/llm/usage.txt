Analysis Report: Time Series Trend of Actively Homeless (All Population)
Overview
The provided time series graph represents the trend in the actively homeless population over a span of years, from 2017 to 2024. The y-axis displays the count of actively homeless individuals, while the x-axis represents the timeline. Key insights from the graph are summarized below.

Key Observations:
Initial Growth (2017–2019):

The number of actively homeless individuals shows a gradual increase from around 8,000 in early 2017 to approximately 10,000 in mid-2019. This trend suggests a steady rise in homelessness over this period.
Volatility in 2019–2020:

There is noticeable volatility from 2019 to 2020, with several peaks and troughs. By early 2020, the homeless population sees a decline but then recovers. The fluctuations might be linked to external economic, political, or policy factors.
Significant Decline (2020):

Around mid-2020, there is a sharp and significant drop in the homeless count, reaching its lowest point, which is below 8,000. This period coincides with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting that the reduction may be due to government interventions such as emergency housing or relief measures.
Recovery Post-COVID (Late 2020–2022):

After the sharp decline, the graph displays a steady rise again from late 2020 to mid-2022, with homelessness numbers surpassing the previous peak. This indicates a return to pre-pandemic levels and potentially the end of temporary relief measures or increased financial instability.
Recent Plateau and Minor Declines (2023–2024):

From 2022 onwards, the count has been fluctuating around 10,500 to 11,000, showing minor declines and recoveries. This plateau suggests that the homelessness situation has stabilized somewhat but remains high, reflecting persistent challenges in reducing the overall homeless population.
Possible Contributing Factors:
Economic Factors:
Rising housing costs, inflation, and other financial challenges in the 2017–2019 period could explain the initial rise in the homeless population.
COVID-19 Pandemic:
The sudden dip in 2020 coincides with the pandemic, during which various measures, such as eviction moratoriums, emergency housing, and stimulus checks, may have temporarily reduced homelessness.
Policy Changes:
The recovery and increase from 2021 onwards could indicate the expiration of temporary relief measures, alongside ongoing economic hardship, potentially leading to renewed growth in the homeless population.
Conclusion:
The graph reveals an overall upward trend in the actively homeless population over the long term, with significant volatility during the pandemic period. Despite some short-term declines, the number of homeless individuals remains elevated as of 2024, suggesting that addressing homelessness will continue to require comprehensive policy efforts and sustained interventions.

Statistical Analysis Report: Actively Homeless Population Trend (2017–2024)
The time series graph presents a fluctuating but overall increasing trend in the actively homeless population from 2017 to 2024. The population ranged between approximately 8,000 to over 11,000 individuals. The data exhibits volatility, particularly between 2019 and 2020, with a significant drop in mid-2020 when the homeless count reached its lowest point, falling below 8,000. This sharp decline is likely related to external interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Following this, the homeless population began to rise rapidly, reaching a peak of over 11,000 by mid-2023. Despite minor fluctuations, the population has plateaued around 10,500 to 11,000 from late 2022 into 2024, indicating relative stability. However, this level remains higher than pre-pandemic counts, suggesting ongoing challenges in reducing homelessness in the longer term. The volatility and overall upward trend suggest complex socio-economic factors influencing homelessness rates, including economic instability and changes in public policies.

Extended Statistical Analysis Report: Actively Homeless Population Trend (2017–2024)
The time series graph displays the trend of the actively homeless population over a seven-year period, from 2017 to 2024. The population fluctuates significantly, with distinct periods of growth, decline, and stabilization. The homeless count ranged from a low of approximately 8,000 individuals to a high exceeding 11,000. Over the entire period, the general trend is upward, though short-term volatility is evident, particularly between 2019 and 2022.

From 2017 to mid-2019, there is a gradual rise in the homeless population, which increases from around 8,000 to about 10,000. This indicates a steady growth rate over this period. However, beginning in late 2019 and into early 2020, the data shows several spikes and dips, reflecting heightened volatility. The first notable spike peaks around mid-2019, followed by a sharp dip and another rise toward early 2020. The highest levels during this period reach around 10,000 individuals, suggesting that external factors like economic changes or housing policy adjustments may have contributed to the irregular movements in the homeless population.

One of the most significant changes occurs in mid-2020, where the population experiences a sharp and rapid decline, dropping below 8,000. This reduction coincides with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and suggests that government interventions, such as emergency housing assistance, eviction moratoriums, or expanded social services, may have had a direct impact on temporarily reducing homelessness. This decline marks the lowest point in the dataset.

However, after the pandemic-driven drop, the homeless population begins to rise steadily from late 2020, eventually surpassing previous highs by mid-2022. This recovery in numbers suggests that temporary relief measures likely expired, and the homelessness crisis worsened again as economic and housing challenges persisted. By mid-2022, the population reached over 11,000, representing the highest level observed during the entire time frame.

From mid-2022 to early 2024, the graph displays a relative plateau in the actively homeless population, with fluctuations between 10,500 and 11,000. While there are minor dips and peaks, the overall trend suggests stabilization at an elevated level. Despite the plateau, the fact that the homeless population remains above pre-pandemic levels indicates that deeper structural issues—such as a lack of affordable housing, continued economic instability, and insufficient long-term policy solutions—are driving persistent homelessness.

In summary, while the time series graph reveals several periods of fluctuation, the overall trend is an increasing homeless population over the past seven years, punctuated by a brief but sharp decline during the pandemic. The post-pandemic recovery in homeless numbers and the subsequent stabilization at higher levels suggest ongoing challenges that require sustained intervention. Statistical analysis points to the need for long-term strategies to address the root causes of homelessness, including economic disparity, housing affordability, and social safety net inadequacies.

Statistical Analysis Report: Actively Homeless Population Trend (2017–2024)
The time series graph shows the trend of the actively homeless population from 2017 to 2024, revealing fluctuations with an overall increasing trajectory. Initially, from 2017 to mid-2019, the homeless population grew steadily from around 8,000 to 10,000. However, significant volatility occurs between late 2019 and 2020, with several peaks and dips in the homeless count, reflecting the influence of various external factors.

A notable event is the sharp decline in mid-2020, when the population dropped below 8,000, likely due to government interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as eviction moratoriums and emergency relief measures. This was the lowest point recorded during the period.

Following this, the population rebounded rapidly, reaching over 11,000 by mid-2022, surpassing previous highs. This rise suggests the expiration of pandemic-related relief programs and a return to economic instability, leading to a worsening homelessness situation.

From 2022 to 2024, the homeless count stabilizes between 10,500 and 11,000, indicating a plateau but at elevated levels compared to pre-pandemic figures. The persistence of high homelessness numbers points to structural issues such as housing affordability and economic disparities.

In conclusion, while temporary measures during the pandemic briefly reduced homelessness, the overall trend is upward, with the population stabilizing at historically high levels. This suggests that long-term solutions are needed to address the root causes of homelessness, including policy reforms and support for affordable housing.

Statistical Analysis Report: Moved to Housing by Population Group
The bar chart illustrates the distribution of individuals moved to housing across various population groups. Among the groups, Refugees represent the largest number of people moved to housing, followed closely by Families and Chronic populations, each with counts exceeding 20,000. Non-refugees and Single Adults also show significant housing placements, though at slightly lower levels, both between 15,000 and 20,000. Youth and Indigenous populations have the lowest counts, with fewer than 10,000 individuals housed, indicating that these groups may face greater challenges in transitioning to housing. The distribution suggests that efforts have been more successful for larger, often more vulnerable groups, such as refugees and families, while certain smaller demographic groups like Indigenous and youth may require additional support or targeted interventions to improve housing outcomes.

Bar Chart vs. Histogram
Bar Chart:

Purpose: Used to represent and compare discrete categories or groups.
Data Type: Categorical data (e.g., population groups, types of products).
Bars: Each bar represents a category, with the height corresponding to the value (e.g., count, percentage). Bars are separated to emphasize the distinct categories.
Example: A bar chart could show the number of people moved to housing across different population groups, like in the graph you provided.
Histogram:

Purpose: Used to display the distribution of a continuous variable and show the frequency of data within certain intervals (bins).
Data Type: Continuous data (e.g., age, income, temperature).
Bars: Bars represent intervals (bins), and the height of each bar shows the frequency of data points within that range. Bars are touching, as they represent ranges of continuous data.
Example: A histogram could show the distribution of ages among people moved to housing, where each bin represents an age range (e.g., 20–30, 30–40).
In summary, bar charts visualize categorical data, while histograms are used for continuous data distributions. The main difference lies in the type of data they represent and how the bars are arranged (discrete vs. continuous).

Statistical Analysis Report: Boxplot of Moved to Housing by Population Group
The boxplot illustrates the distribution of individuals moved to housing across various population groups. Each box represents the interquartile range (IQR), with the line inside the box denoting the median value. The Refugees group exhibits the widest spread, indicating a high level of variability in housing counts, with a median around 400 and several outliers. Families also have a broad range, with a median close to 300, suggesting that a significant number of families have been moved to housing, though there is notable variability in the data.

Chronic and Single Adult groups show a more compact distribution, with their medians near 200 and 100, respectively. Non-refugees have the smallest spread, indicating low variability with a median just above 100. The Indigenous and Youth groups show the lowest counts, with medians near or below 100 and several outliers, indicating smaller but consistent efforts to move these populations to housing.

Overall, the boxplot highlights considerable variation in housing efforts among different population groups, with Refugees and Families seeing the largest efforts, while Youth and Indigenous groups exhibit smaller, more consistent housing outcomes.

It seems there might be an issue with how the cleaned_data is being created or referenced. Ensure that the variable names match and that the data frame cleaned_data is properly defined before attempting to write it to a CSV file.

Here's a corrected version of the code to troubleshoot and fix this issue:
#### Workspace setup ####
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)

#### Clean data ####
# Load the raw data
raw_data <- read_csv("/Users/abcdefg/Desktop/starter_folder-main/data/raw_data/raw_data.csv")

# Filter for 'All Population' and select the required columns
cleaned_data <- raw_data %>%
  filter(population_group == 'All Population') %>%  # Ensure 'population_group' is a valid column name
  select(Actively.Homeless.count, Population.Group, Moved.to.Housing.count, Date.mmm.yy)

# View the cleaned data (optional, for verification)
head(cleaned_data)

#### Save the cleaned data ####
write_csv(cleaned_data, "/Users/abcdefg/Desktop/starter_folder-main/data/analysis_data/analysis_data.csv")

Steps to Check:
Column names: Verify that the column names population_group, Actively.Homeless.count, Population.Group, Moved.to.Housing.count, and Date.mmm.yy are correct and exist in your raw_data dataset. If any names differ, update them in the select() and filter() functions accordingly.
Debugging: Run the head(raw_data) command right after loading raw_data to check the actual column names and data structure, ensuring that the expected columns exist in your dataset.
If you still encounter the issue, run the following to display the column names:
colnames(raw_data)
This will help ensure that you're referencing the correct column names when filtering and selecting.

df$raw_data <- as.Date(paste0('01-', df$date.mmm.yy.), format = '%d-%b-%y')Error in df$date.mmm.yy. : object of type 'closure' is not subsettable

ChatGPT
Generated by DALL·E

The error you're encountering, **"object of type 'closure' is not subsettable"**, happens because you're likely trying to reference a function (or an incorrectly named object) rather than the correct column of your data frame. Specifically, it seems that the column name `date.mmm.yy.` might not be correctly referenced or doesn't exist in the dataframe.

Here’s how you can fix the issue and ensure you're referencing the correct column:

### Steps to resolve:

1. **Check the Column Names:**
   First, ensure that the column `date.mmm.yy.` exists in your dataframe `df`. You can check the column names with:

   ```r
   colnames(df)
   ```

2. **Correct Column Reference:**
   If the column name contains special characters like `.` at the end (as in `date.mmm.yy.`), ensure you're referencing it correctly. If your column name does not contain the trailing dot (`date.mmm.yy` instead), adjust the column name accordingly.

   Also, ensure the data frame you're referencing is correct (`df` in this case).

### Corrected Code Example:

Assuming your column is correctly named `date.mmm.yy` and contains date strings like "Sep-21", here's how you can convert it to `Date` format properly:

```r
# Check the column name
colnames(df)

# Convert the date column to a Date object
df$raw_date <- as.Date(paste0('01-', df$`date.mmm.yy`), format = '%d-%b-%y')

# View the first few rows of the dataframe to verify
head(df)
```

### Potential Issues to Verify:
1. **Column Name Typo:** If the column name is different from `date.mmm.yy`, replace it with the actual name (e.g., `df$date_column`).
2. **Date Format:** The date conversion format `'%d-%b-%y'` assumes the dates are in "MMM-YY" format (e.g., "Sep-21"). If your date format is different, adjust accordingly.

Let me know if the column names or format need further clarification!

Yes, you can delete the code `all_population_df <- df %>% filter(population_group == 'All Population')` if you no longer need to filter the dataset for the "All Population" group. However, this means that the plot will now reflect data from all population groups unless you have filtered or processed the dataset elsewhere.

Here’s the updated code with the unnecessary line removed:

```r
```{r}
#| label: time-series-trend
#| fig-cap: Time Series Trend of Actively Homeless
#| echo: false
#| warning: false

#### First Graph ####

## This code is based on knowledge from Alexander (2024).(改一下 不要ao)

# Plot actively homeless trend over time
ggplot(data, aes(x = date, y = actively_homeless)) +
  geom_line(color = 'blue') +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = 'Time Series Trend of Actively Homeless',
       x = 'Date', y = 'Actively Homeless Count') +
  theme_minimal()
```

Now the plot will use the `data` dataframe without any filtering for a specific population group. If the goal is to visualize the overall homeless trend for all population groups, this should work fine. However, if you still want to focus only on the "All Population" group, you may need to keep that filter step. Let me know if you want to filter or need further clarification.

write some test for the simulated data, do not use the library(testthat)

ChatGPT
Here are a few simple tests you can implement manually to check the validity of the simulated data. You don't need to use the `testthat` package; instead, you can use basic `if` statements and assertions to validate the data:

### 1. **Test that no negative values exist:**
   Since the values generated for numeric columns should be positive, you can check that all values are non-negative.

### 2. **Test that the correct number of rows are generated:**
   Ensure that the number of rows in the simulated data matches the expected number (number of dates × number of population groups).

### 3. **Test that the date format is correct:**
   Verify that the `date` column has been correctly formatted as date objects.

### 4. **Test for column existence:**
   Ensure that all the expected columns exist in the final dataset.

Here’s the code that implements these tests:

```r
#### Manual Tests for Simulated Data ####

# Test 1: Ensure no negative values in numeric columns
numeric_columns <- c("returned_from_housing", "returned_to_shelter", "newly_identified", 
                     "moved_to_housing", "became_inactive", "actively_homeless", 
                     "ageunder16", "age16_24", "age25_34", "age35_44", "age45_54", 
                     "age55_64", "age65over", "gender_male", "gender_female", 
                     "gender_transgender_non_binary_two_spirit")

for (col in numeric_columns) {
  if (any(simulated_data[[col]] < 0)) {
    stop(paste("Test failed: Negative values found in", col))
  }
}

# Test 2: Check the number of rows (expected: 12 months × 5 population groups = 60 rows)
expected_rows <- length(dates) * length(population_groups)
if (nrow(simulated_data) != expected_rows) {
  stop(paste("Test failed: Expected", expected_rows, "rows but got", nrow(simulated_data)))
}

# Test 3: Ensure 'date' column is properly formatted as a Date object
if (!inherits(simulated_data$date, "Date")) {
  stop("Test failed: 'date' column is not of Date type")
}

# Test 4: Check that all expected columns exist
expected_columns <- c("date", "population_group", numeric_columns, "population_group_percentage")
missing_columns <- setdiff(expected_columns, colnames(simulated_data))

if (length(missing_columns) > 0) {
  stop(paste("Test failed: Missing columns:", paste(missing_columns, collapse = ", ")))
}

# If all tests pass
cat("All tests passed successfully!\n")
```

### Explanation of the Tests:
1. **Test 1 (No Negative Values):** Loops through all numeric columns and checks that no negative values exist. It throws an error if a negative value is found.
2. **Test 2 (Row Count):** Verifies that the number of rows in `simulated_data` matches the expected number (12 months × 5 population groups = 60).
3. **Test 3 (Date Format):** Ensures that the `date` column is a valid Date object.
4. **Test 4 (Column Existence):** Checks that all expected columns are present in the `simulated_data`.

### Running the Tests:
Simply run the above code after generating your `simulated_data`. If all the conditions are met, the script will output "All tests passed successfully!" If any test fails, it will stop and provide an error message indicating which test failed and why.

write test use the library(tidyverse)

ChatGPT
Here’s how you can write tests using only the `tidyverse` library to validate your `simulated_data`. Instead of using the `testthat` package, we will leverage `dplyr` functions and some logical checks to test the data.

### Test 1: No negative values in numeric columns
We'll use `filter()` and `any()` to check if there are any negative values in the numeric columns.

### Test 2: Correct number of rows
We'll check the number of rows using `nrow()` and compare it to the expected number (12 months × 5 population groups = 60).

### Test 3: Date column is of Date type
We'll check if the `date` column is a `Date` object using `class()`.

### Test 4: Ensure all expected columns exist
We'll compare the names of the columns in the data to the expected column names using `setdiff()`.

### Here's the code for these tests using `tidyverse`:

```r
#### Manual Tests for Simulated Data using tidyverse ####

# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)

# Test 1: Ensure no negative values in numeric columns
numeric_columns <- c("returned_from_housing", "returned_to_shelter", "newly_identified", 
                     "moved_to_housing", "became_inactive", "actively_homeless", 
                     "ageunder16", "age16_24", "age25_34", "age35_44", "age45_54", 
                     "age55_64", "age65over", "gender_male", "gender_female", 
                     "gender_transgender_non_binary_two_spirit")

# Create a filter to find any negative values in numeric columns
negative_values <- simulated_data %>%
  filter(across(all_of(numeric_columns), ~ . < 0))

# Check if any rows with negative values are found
if (nrow(negative_values) > 0) {
  stop("Test failed: Negative values found in numeric columns.")
}

# Test 2: Check the number of rows (expected: 12 months × 5 population groups = 60 rows)
expected_rows <- length(dates) * length(population_groups)
if (nrow(simulated_data) != expected_rows) {
  stop(paste("Test failed: Expected", expected_rows, "rows but got", nrow(simulated_data)))
}

# Test 3: Ensure 'date' column is properly formatted as a Date object
if (!inherits(simulated_data$date, "Date")) {
  stop("Test failed: 'date' column is not of Date type.")
}

# Test 4: Check that all expected columns exist
expected_columns <- c("date", "population_group", numeric_columns, "population_group_percentage")
missing_columns <- setdiff(expected_columns, colnames(simulated_data))

if (length(missing_columns) > 0) {
  stop(paste("Test failed: Missing columns:", paste(missing_columns, collapse = ", ")))
}

# If all tests pass
cat("All tests passed successfully!\n")
```

### Breakdown of the tests:

1. **Test 1 (No Negative Values):**
   - We use `across()` within `filter()` to check all numeric columns for negative values. If any row has a negative value, the result is filtered into `negative_values`. If `nrow(negative_values)` is greater than 0, it means we found some rows with negative values, so the test fails.

2. **Test 2 (Correct Number of Rows):**
   - We calculate the expected number of rows (12 months × 5 population groups = 60 rows). If `nrow(simulated_data)` does not match `expected_rows`, the test fails.

3. **Test 3 (Date Column Type):**
   - We check if the `date` column is of class `Date` using `inherits()`. If not, the test fails.

4. **Test 4 (Column Existence):**
   - We use `setdiff()` to compare the column names in `simulated_data` with the expected column names. If any columns are missing, the test fails and prints the missing column names.

### Running the Tests:
Simply run the above code after generating your `simulated_data`. If all conditions are met, the script will output "All tests passed successfully!" If any test fails, it will stop and provide an error message explaining why the test failed.

write tests in the format like this data$number_of_marriage |> min() <= 0# Test for NAsall(is.na(data$number_of_marriage))

ChatGPT
Here is how you can write tests for your `simulated_data` in a similar format using pipes (`|>`) and logical checks:

### Test 1: Ensure no negative values in numeric columns
We use `across()` and check if the minimum value in each numeric column is greater than or equal to 0.

### Test 2: Check for NAs
We check if any of the numeric columns contain `NA` values.

### Test 3: Correct number of rows
We verify that the number of rows matches the expected value using `nrow()`.

### Test 4: Check if the `date` column is in Date format
We ensure that the `date` column is correctly formatted as a Date object.

### Test 5: Ensure all required columns are present
We use `all()` to check if the expected columns are present in the data.

Here is the complete code with the tests in the requested format:

### Explanation of the tests:

1. **Test 1 (No Negative Values):** 
   - We use `purrr::map()` to iterate over `numeric_columns` and check that the minimum value in each column is greater than or equal to 0. If any column fails, the test stops and outputs an error message.

2. **Test 2 (No NAs):**
   - For each numeric column, we check that all values are not `NA` using `all(is.na() == FALSE)`. If any column has `NA` values, the test will fail.

3. **Test 3 (Number of Rows):**
   - We check if the number of rows is 60 (12 months × 5 population groups). If not, it stops and reports an error.

4. **Test 4 (Date Column Type):**
   - This test ensures the `date` column is correctly formatted as a Date object.

5. **Test 5 (Column Existence):**
   - We use `%in%` to ensure that all expected columns are present in the dataframe.

### Running the Tests:
When you run the above code after generating your `simulated_data`, it will either confirm that all tests passed successfully or stop and inform you which test failed.

write 4 test for this data:

ChatGPT
Based on the dataset structure, here are four tests that can be written for this data:

1. **Test 1: No negative values in `actively_homeless` and `moved_to_housing` columns.**
   - These columns should contain only non-negative values since homelessness counts and housing movements cannot be negative.

2. **Test 2: Check for missing values (NA) in critical columns (`date`, `actively_homeless`, `population_group`, and `moved_to_housing`).**
   - There should be no missing values in any of these essential columns.

3. **Test 3: Verify that the `date` column is in proper date format.**
   - Ensure that the `date` column is in the correct date format (YYYY-MM-DD).

4. **Test 4: Ensure that the `population_group` column contains expected population categories.**
   - The `population_group` column should only contain predefined values such as "All Population", "Chronic", "Refugees", "Families", and "Youth".

Here's the Python code that implements these tests:

```python
# Test 1: No negative values in 'actively_homeless' and 'moved_to_housing'
assert (data['actively_homeless'] >= 0).all(), "Test failed: Negative values found in 'actively_homeless'"
assert (data['moved_to_housing'] >= 0).all(), "Test failed: Negative values found in 'moved_to_housing'"

# Test 2: Check for missing values in key columns
assert data[['date', 'actively_homeless', 'population_group', 'moved_to_housing']].isnull().sum().sum() == 0, \
    "Test failed: Missing values found in one or more key columns"

# Test 3: Ensure 'date' column is in correct date format
data['date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['date'], errors='coerce')
assert data['date'].notnull().all(), "Test failed: Invalid dates or incorrect date format found in 'date' column"

# Test 4: Ensure 'population_group' contains only expected categories
expected_groups = {"All Population", "Chronic", "Refugees", "Families", "Youth"}
assert set(data['population_group'].unique()).issubset(expected_groups), \
    "Test failed: Unexpected values found in 'population_group' column"

print("All tests passed successfully!")
```

### Test Explanation:

1. **Test 1:** Ensures there are no negative values in the `actively_homeless` and `moved_to_housing` columns.
2. **Test 2:** Checks for missing values in the critical columns (`date`, `actively_homeless`, `population_group`, and `moved_to_housing`).
3. **Test 3:** Converts the `date` column to `datetime` format and verifies that all entries are valid dates.
4. **Test 4:** Confirms that the `population_group` column contains only predefined categories.

### Homelessness and Housing Trends Analysis Report

#### 1. Introduction

Homelessness remains a critical societal issue worldwide, impacting both urban and rural areas. The problem is particularly pressing in urban centers where housing affordability, economic instability, and social services are often strained. Homelessness affects vulnerable populations disproportionately, including families, refugees, Indigenous people, youth, and individuals facing chronic homelessness. These groups face unique challenges that can prevent them from securing stable housing, despite various efforts by governmental and non-governmental organizations.

This report focuses on the analysis of homelessness trends and housing movements in the period between 2018 and 2024. The objective is to assess the changes in the homeless population, evaluate the effectiveness of housing interventions, and identify which population groups are most affected by homelessness. Understanding these trends is essential for policymakers, social services, and community organizations in formulating targeted interventions to alleviate homelessness and improve housing stability.

By leveraging a comprehensive dataset on the actively homeless population and those moved to housing, this report aims to highlight the nuances within the homelessness crisis. The analysis is structured around key questions: How has the actively homeless population changed over time? What impact did the COVID-19 pandemic have on homelessness? Which population groups have benefited the most from housing initiatives, and which groups remain underserved? Addressing these questions provides a foundation for developing more effective policies and programs that can address the root causes of homelessness and ensure more equitable access to housing solutions.

The subsequent sections of this report will delve into detailed time series analysis of the homeless population, explore population-specific trends, and assess the outcomes of housing programs aimed at moving individuals from homelessness into stable housing situations.

#### 2. Data Overview

The dataset used in this analysis spans from 2018 to 2024 and includes monthly records of the actively homeless population, broken down by key population groups. These population groups include "Chronic," "Refugees," "Families," "Indigenous," "Youth," "Single Adults," and "Non-refugees." Each of these groups faces unique challenges when it comes to accessing housing, and the dataset provides an opportunity to examine these challenges in depth.

Key variables in the dataset include:
- **Actively Homeless Count:** The total number of individuals who were homeless during a given month.
- **Population Group:** The group to which the homeless individual belongs, allowing for a breakdown of trends across different demographic groups.
- **Moved to Housing Count:** The number of individuals from each population group who were successfully transitioned from homelessness to housing during a given month.

The **time series data** tracks changes in homelessness month by month, providing a rich view of how external events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, affected homelessness levels. By capturing monthly changes, the dataset allows for detailed analysis of seasonal patterns and how homelessness trends may fluctuate in response to social, economic, or policy shifts.

Additionally, the dataset includes information on the effectiveness of housing interventions through the "Moved to Housing" variable, which tracks the number of homeless individuals successfully placed into stable housing. This variable is crucial for understanding which population groups are being effectively served by housing programs and which may require additional resources or targeted interventions to ensure their transition out of homelessness.

Overall, the dataset provides a comprehensive view of homelessness trends over six years, with a focus on both the overall population and specific subgroups. The combination of these variables allows for a multi-dimensional analysis, enabling us to not only identify trends but also to understand the factors driving these trends. This detailed approach is critical for informing future policy decisions and improving the design of homelessness interventions.

In the following sections, we will explore the results of this analysis through visual representations of homelessness trends and housing movements, focusing on both the overall population and specific vulnerable groups. The insights derived from this analysis will form the basis of recommendations for future homelessness reduction strategies.

#### 4. Discussion

The analysis of homelessness trends between 2018 and 2024 reveals several important insights into the evolving nature of homelessness and the impact of housing interventions. The findings indicate that while some progress has been made, particularly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, significant challenges remain. The discussion below highlights the key themes emerging from the analysis, focusing on the impact of the pandemic, population-specific trends, and the effectiveness of current housing programs.

##### 4.1 Impact of COVID-19 on Homelessness Trends

One of the most striking features in the data is the sharp decline in homelessness observed during 2020, corresponding with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This sudden drop likely reflects the emergency measures implemented to protect vulnerable populations from the virus, such as temporary housing solutions, eviction moratoriums, and increased social support. Governments worldwide, including those in Canada, enacted emergency responses to prevent mass displacement and shelter overcrowding, which could have contributed to the decrease in the actively homeless population.

However, this decline was temporary. As the pandemic subsided and emergency measures were lifted, the homeless population rebounded sharply. By mid-2021, the number of homeless individuals had not only returned to pre-pandemic levels but had exceeded them, peaking at over 11,000 in 2023. This suggests that while emergency measures can offer short-term relief, they are not a substitute for long-term, sustainable solutions to homelessness. The rapid rise in homelessness post-pandemic indicates that underlying structural issues, such as housing affordability, income inequality, and insufficient mental health and addiction services, remain unaddressed.

The pandemic also highlighted the vulnerabilities of certain groups more acutely. For example, refugees and families experienced significant fluctuations during this period, likely due to disruptions in housing availability and support services. As a result, this underscores the need for more resilient and adaptable housing policies that can respond not only to crises like the pandemic but also to ongoing challenges faced by vulnerable populations.

##### 4.2 Disparities in Population-Specific Homelessness Trends

The analysis reveals significant disparities across different population groups, particularly with regard to their experiences of homelessness and access to housing. While the overall homeless population has fluctuated, specific groups have experienced unique trends that require closer examination.

- **Chronic Population:** The most concerning trend is the steady increase in homelessness among the chronic population, which nearly tripled from 2018 to 2024. This group typically includes individuals who have been homeless for extended periods and who often face multiple barriers to housing, such as mental health challenges, substance use disorders, and disabilities. The data suggests that current interventions are insufficient for this group, and there is a clear need for more targeted, long-term support, including permanent supportive housing, healthcare, and rehabilitation services. The rise in chronic homelessness suggests that without comprehensive, wrap-around services, this group is unlikely to exit homelessness sustainably.

- **Refugees:** Refugees have also seen a dramatic rise in homelessness, particularly in the post-pandemic years. This group is particularly vulnerable due to language barriers, limited access to employment, and often precarious legal statuses. The sharp increase in homelessness among refugees likely reflects broader geopolitical trends, including global migration crises and the displacement of populations due to conflict or environmental factors. Policy responses need to focus on integrating refugees into the housing system more effectively, perhaps through transitional housing programs and employment services that are tailored to their specific needs.

- **Indigenous Population:** Indigenous homelessness also exhibited a concerning pattern, with a steep rise up until 2022, followed by a gradual decline. Indigenous people often face systemic discrimination, limited access to culturally appropriate services, and overrepresentation in homeless populations. The slight decline in 2023 and 2024 may suggest that some targeted interventions have been effective, but the relatively high levels of homelessness within this group highlight the ongoing challenges. Addressing Indigenous homelessness requires a culturally sensitive approach, grounded in Indigenous-led solutions that address the root causes, such as historical and ongoing colonization, land dispossession, and intergenerational trauma.

- **Youth and Single Adults:** These two groups exhibit moderate increases in homelessness over time. Youth, in particular, face distinct challenges, including family conflict, aging out of the foster care system, and economic instability. Single adults, while experiencing a slower increase compared to other groups, remain a significant portion of the homeless population. Targeted interventions for youth should include prevention strategies, such as family mediation and mental health services, while single adults may benefit from increased access to affordable housing and job training programs.

##### 4.3 Effectiveness of Housing Interventions

The boxplot of housing movements (Fig. 2) provides critical insights into the disparities in how different population groups are accessing housing. The fact that refugees and families see higher overall counts of individuals moved to housing reflects a focus on these groups by housing initiatives. This is likely due to the presence of more robust social safety nets and support services for families and refugee resettlement programs. However, while the sheer number of movements is high, the variation within these groups suggests that not all individuals are benefiting equally from these interventions. This variation could be due to differences in regional housing availability, eligibility for certain programs, or barriers such as income requirements and access to resources.

In contrast, groups like the Indigenous population, youth, and single adults have fewer housing movements, which highlights a gap in the housing system. The low numbers for Indigenous populations and youth, in particular, suggest that current housing programs may not be reaching or adequately supporting these groups. Tailored interventions, such as Indigenous-led housing solutions and youth-specific support programs, are essential to ensure these groups do not continue to fall through the cracks.

The consistency in housing movements for the **chronic population** is a positive sign, indicating that housing-first models and long-term supportive housing may be working for some individuals. However, the increasing number of chronically homeless individuals suggests that while the programs in place are effective for those they serve, they are not scaling quickly enough to meet the growing demand. Expanding supportive housing programs and providing more resources for mental health and addiction services could help address this gap.

##### 4.4 Policy Implications

The findings from this analysis have several policy implications. First, it is clear that emergency measures, such as those enacted during the pandemic, can offer short-term relief, but they must be accompanied by long-term strategies to ensure lasting reductions in homelessness. This requires investment in

#### 4. Discussion

The analysis of homelessness trends from 2018 to 2024 reveals important insights into the impact of external events and the effectiveness of housing interventions. The sharp decline in homelessness during 2020 corresponds to emergency measures taken during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as eviction moratoriums and temporary housing solutions. However, this was followed by a rapid increase in homelessness after the pandemic, indicating that these interventions, while effective short-term, failed to address long-term structural issues like housing affordability and systemic inequality.

The data shows considerable disparities across different population groups. **Chronic homelessness** has seen a steady rise, suggesting current interventions are insufficient. This group requires long-term support such as permanent supportive housing. **Refugees** also experienced significant increases in homelessness post-pandemic, likely due to barriers in accessing housing and employment, highlighting the need for tailored support programs. **Indigenous** and **youth populations** show lower rates of being moved to housing, signaling the need for culturally appropriate services and youth-targeted interventions.

Housing interventions, while beneficial for some groups like **families** and **refugees**, are not uniformly effective. The **Indigenous** and **chronic populations** remain underserved. Expanding supportive housing and ensuring culturally appropriate and youth-specific programs are crucial to addressing these gaps. The overall increase in homelessness, especially for vulnerable groups, underscores the need for sustained, long-term policy efforts focused on affordable housing and equitable access to services.

For the **All Population**, homelessness fluctuates, showing a sharp decline around 2020, likely due to pandemic interventions, followed by a significant rebound and stabilization near 11,000 in 2024. The **Chronic** population shows a persistent increase, doubling from 4,000 to over 8,000 by 2024, indicating that this group faces growing challenges. **Families** and **Indigenous populations** initially experience declines, but homelessness rebounds for families while Indigenous numbers show a decline after peaking in 2022. **Non-refugees** see a gradual decrease in recent years, while the **Refugees** group experiences a significant rise in homelessness, peaking at over 6,000 in 2024. **Single Adults** show steady growth in homelessness, increasing to over 7,000, and **Youth** exhibit fluctuations, with a sharp recovery post-2020. Overall, the graph highlights that while some groups have seen improvements, others, particularly chronic and refugee populations, continue to face rising homelessness.

### Abstract

This report analyzes homelessness trends and housing interventions from 2018 to 2024, focusing on key population groups such as chronic homeless individuals, refugees, families, Indigenous peoples, and youth. Using time series data, the study explores fluctuations in the actively homeless population, highlighting the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which temporarily reduced homelessness through emergency interventions. However, the data shows a rapid resurgence in homelessness post-pandemic, particularly for vulnerable groups like refugees and the chronically homeless. The report also examines disparities in housing movements, revealing that while some groups, such as families and refugees, benefited from housing programs, others, including Indigenous peoples and youth, remained underserved. The analysis emphasizes the need for long-term, sustainable policy interventions targeting the root causes of homelessness, including housing affordability, mental health support, and income inequality. These findings underscore the importance of population-specific approaches to reduce homelessness and improve housing outcomes.

Figure 1 presents a fluctuating but overall increasing trend in the actively homeless population from 2017 to 2024. The population ranged between approximately 8,000 to over 11,000 individuals during this period, demonstrating substantial volatility. The most notable fluctuation occurred between 2019 and 2020, where the data shows a significant drop in mid-2020, with the homeless count falling below 8,000—the lowest point observed during the seven-year period. This sharp decline is likely tied to the external interventions implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic (Leung et al., 2008). Pandemic-driven policies, such as eviction moratoriums, emergency housing programs, and expanded social safety nets, temporarily alleviated homelessness. However, these interventions proved to be short-term solutions.

By late 2020, as pandemic restrictions eased and emergency measures were lifted, the homeless population began to rise again, reflecting the fragility of these temporary fixes. The upward trend continued steadily, reaching a peak of over 11,000 individuals by mid-2023, indicating that the underlying causes of homelessness remained unresolved. Despite minor fluctuations, the population has plateaued between 10,500 and 11,000 from late 2022 into 2024, suggesting some level of stability but at a higher level than pre-pandemic counts. This elevated baseline points to ongoing challenges in reducing homelessness, as the numbers remain significantly higher than before the pandemic, suggesting that socio-economic instability continues to drive homelessness.

The data suggests that the volatility and overall upward trend are driven by a combination of complex socio-economic factors. Economic instability, including rising housing costs, unemployment, and stagnant wages, likely played a significant role. Additionally, changes in public policies, such as the reduction of social safety nets or insufficient affordable housing initiatives, have contributed to the persistent rise in homelessness. The lack of long-term, systemic interventions capable of addressing these underlying issues means that homelessness is not only a symptom of short-term crises like the pandemic but also a deeper reflection of socio-economic inequalities and the inadequacies of current housing policies. Addressing these challenges requires comprehensive, sustained efforts aimed at improving housing affordability, expanding access to social services, and creating stable economic conditions.

Figure 1 shows a fluctuating but generally increasing trend in the actively homeless population from 2017 to 2024, with numbers ranging between 8,000 and over 11,000. There is notable volatility, particularly between 2019 and 2020, when the population experienced a sharp drop in mid-2020, falling below 8,000. This decline is likely due to pandemic-related interventions such as eviction moratoriums and emergency housing measures (Leung et al., 2008). However, these temporary solutions were followed by a rapid increase, with the homeless population rising steadily after late 2020. By mid-2023, the number surpassed 11,000 individuals.

From late 2022 into 2024, the homeless count plateaued between 10,500 and 11,000, suggesting some stabilization but at a higher level than pre-pandemic figures. This persistent elevation indicates ongoing difficulties in reducing homelessness, highlighting the long-term effects of economic instability and housing shortages. The volatility and overall upward trend suggest that homelessness is influenced by a combination of socio-economic factors, such as rising housing costs and limited access to affordable housing. Despite some stabilization, the elevated baseline points to the need for long-term policy solutions that address the root causes of homelessness, including economic disparities and inadequate housing policies.

what is Summary statistics in this context

This criterion is linked to a Learning OutcomeData
A sense of the dataset should be communicated to the reader. The broader context of the dataset should be discussed. All variables should be thoroughly examined and explained. Explain if there were similar datasets that could have been used and why they were not. If variables were constructed then this should be mentioned, and high-level cleaning aspects of note should be mentioned, but this section should focus on the destination, not the journey. It is important to understand what the variables look like by including graphs, and possibly tables, of all observations, along with discussion of those graphs and the other features of these data. Summary statistics should also be included, and well as any relationships between the variables. If this becomes too detailed, then appendices could be used.


ChatGPT
In this context, Summary Statistics refers to key numerical values that provide an overview of the data, helping to describe and summarize its main characteristics. These statistics give readers an overall sense of the dataset without diving too deep into specific details of individual observations. Typically, they include:

Central Tendency: Measures like the mean (average), median (middle value), and mode (most frequent value) of variables such as "actively homeless" or "moved to housing" give an idea of where most of the data points lie.

Dispersion: This includes values like standard deviation, variance, and interquartile range, which indicate how spread out the data is. For example, how much variation is there in homelessness counts across months or different population groups?

Min/Max Values: The minimum and maximum values of key variables help to understand the range of the data, such as the lowest and highest counts of homeless individuals during the observation period.

Count and Distribution: Simple counts of observations (such as the number of months of data) and how data points are distributed across categories (e.g., population groups) are helpful in giving an overall understanding of the dataset.

Correlations and Relationships: Summary statistics may also include correlations or relationships between variables, such as whether an increase in "moved to housing" is associated with a decrease in "actively homeless," or how different population groups compare in terms of homelessness trends over time.

In this context, you would generate summary statistics for each variable in the dataset (such as "actively homeless," "population group," "moved to housing," etc.), and present them alongside visualizations (like histograms or boxplots). These statistics and graphs help to summarize and explain the overall behavior of the data to the reader without getting bogged down in excessive detail.

If the detail gets too complex, it’s suggested to move parts of this to appendices to keep the main body focused on high-level insights while still providing all relevant information.

rewrite this paragraph:

The Shelter System Flow data shares information about people experiencing homelessness who are entering and leaving the shelter system each month, including the number of unique people who have used the shelter system at least one time in the past three months and are considered to be actively experiencing homelessness (ie; they were not discharged to permanent housing).

ChatGPT
The Shelter System Flow data provides monthly information on individuals experiencing homelessness who are entering or exiting the shelter system. It includes the number of unique individuals who have used the shelter system at least once within the past three months and are still considered to be actively homeless, meaning they have not been discharged to permanent housing.

draw some graph based on these data (programming language: R language)
ChatGPT:
The dataset contains various columns related to Toronto's shelter system, including information about population groups, return rates, new identifications, housing movements, and demographic details.

Here are the column headers for reference:
- `date(mmm-yy)`: Month and year
- `population_group`: Population group (e.g., Chronic, Refugees)
- `returned_from_housing`: Number of people returning from housing
- `returned_to_shelter`: Number of people returning to shelter
- `newly_identified`: Number of newly identified individuals
- `moved_to_housing`: Number of individuals moved to housing
- `became_inactive`: Number of individuals who became inactive
- `actively_homeless`: Number of people actively homeless
- Demographic breakdowns by age and gender

Please specify the type of graph you'd like to create (e.g., time series, bar chart, comparison between groups), and the data you'd like to visualize.


User:
just choose some data you think is valuable to evaluate
ChatGPT:
I'll create a few graphs to evaluate different aspects of the data:

1. **Time Series Trend**: I will plot the trend of the `actively_homeless` population over time, aggregated for all population groups. This will give us insight into how the overall homelessness number changes month to month.
   
2. **Population Group Comparison**: I'll create a bar graph comparing different population groups (`Chronic`, `Refugees`, `Families`, `Youth`) based on their `moved_to_housing` count. This will show which groups are most likely to move to housing.
   
3. **Age Distribution**: I'll visualize the distribution of age groups for the `All Population` in a bar chart to understand which age groups are most represented in the shelter system.

Let me generate these graphs.

I have created the following visualizations based on the shelter data:

1. **Time Series Trend of Actively Homeless**: This graph shows the trend of the actively homeless population across time for the "All Population" group.
   
2. **Moved to Housing by Population Group**: This bar chart compares different population groups based on how many people moved to housing. It highlights which groups are being successfully housed more often.

3. **Age Distribution (All Population)**: This bar chart visualizes the distribution of individuals by age group in the shelter system for the "All Population" group.

User:
no the graph should be in R languages
ChatGPT:
Got it! Here's how you can generate similar graphs using the R language. I'll provide code for each of the three graphs you requested.

### 1. **Time Series Trend of Actively Homeless**
This will plot the `actively_homeless` count over time for the "All Population" group.

```r
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Load the CSV data
df <- read.csv('toronto-shelter-system-flow.csv')

# Convert date to proper format
df$date <- as.Date(paste0('01-', df$`date.mmm.yy`), format = '%d-%b-%y')

# Filter for 'All Population'
all_population_df <- df %>% filter(population_group == 'All Population')

# Plot actively homeless trend over time
ggplot(all_population_df, aes(x = date, y = actively_homeless)) +
  geom_line(color = 'blue') +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = 'Time Series Trend of Actively Homeless (All Population)',
       x = 'Date', y = 'Actively Homeless Count') +
  theme_minimal()
```

### 2. **Bar Graph of Moved to Housing by Population Group**

```r
# Filter out 'All Population' and group by population_group
population_group_df <- df %>% 
  filter(population_group != 'All Population') %>%
  group_by(population_group) %>%
  summarise(moved_to_housing = sum(moved_to_housing))

# Plot bar graph
ggplot(population_group_df, aes(x = reorder(population_group, -moved_to_housing), y = moved_to_housing)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', fill = 'green') +
  labs(title = 'Moved to Housing by Population Group', 
       x = 'Population Group', y = 'Moved to Housing Count') +
  theme_minimal() +
  coord_flip() # To rotate the bar chart horizontally
```

### 3. **Age Distribution for All Population**

```r
# Summarize age groups for 'All Population'
age_columns <- c('ageunder16', 'age16.24', 'age25.34', 'age35.44', 'age45.54', 'age55.64', 'age65over')
age_distribution <- all_population_df %>%
  summarise(across(all_of(age_columns), sum, na.rm = TRUE))

# Reshape data for plotting
age_distribution <- gather(age_distribution, key = "age_group", value = "count")

# Plot age distribution
ggplot(age_distribution, aes(x = age_group, y = count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', fill = 'cyan') +
  labs(title = 'Age Distribution (All Population)', x = 'Age Group', y = 'Population Count') +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Summary:
- The **first plot** is a time series of the actively homeless population for all groups.
- The **second plot** is a bar graph showing the number of people moved to housing by population group.
- The **third plot** shows the age distribution for the "All Population" group.

Error in df$date.mmm.yy : object of type 'closure' is not subsettable
ChatGPT:
The error you're encountering, **"object of type 'closure' is not subsettable"**, occurs because backticks are needed to refer to column names that contain special characters (like `.` or parentheses) in R.

To fix this issue, use backticks around the column name. Here's the corrected code:

### 1. **Time Series Trend of Actively Homeless** (Fixed)

```r
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Load the CSV data
df <- read.csv('toronto-shelter-system-flow.csv')

# Convert date to proper format using backticks for column name
df$date <- as.Date(paste0('01-', df$`date.mmm.yy`), format = '%d-%b-%y')

# Filter for 'All Population'
all_population_df <- df %>% filter(population_group == 'All Population')

# Plot actively homeless trend over time
ggplot(all_population_df, aes(x = date, y = actively_homeless)) +
  geom_line(color = 'blue') +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = 'Time Series Trend of Actively Homeless (All Population)',
       x = 'Date', y = 'Actively Homeless Count') +
  theme_minimal()
```

### 2. **Bar Graph of Moved to Housing by Population Group** (Fixed)

```r
# Filter out 'All Population' and group by population_group
population_group_df <- df %>% 
  filter(population_group != 'All Population') %>%
  group_by(population_group) %>%
  summarise(moved_to_housing = sum(moved_to_housing, na.rm = TRUE))

# Plot bar graph
ggplot(population_group_df, aes(x = reorder(population_group, -moved_to_housing), y = moved_to_housing)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', fill = 'green') +
  labs(title = 'Moved to Housing by Population Group', 
       x = 'Population Group', y = 'Moved to Housing Count') +
  theme_minimal() +
  coord_flip() # To rotate the bar chart horizontally
```

### 3. **Age Distribution for All Population** (Fixed)

```r
# Summarize age groups for 'All Population'
age_columns <- c('ageunder16', 'age16.24', 'age25.34', 'age35.44', 'age45.54', 'age55.64', 'age65over')
age_distribution <- all_population_df %>%
  summarise(across(all_of(age_columns), sum, na.rm = TRUE))

# Reshape data for plotting
age_distribution <- gather(age_distribution, key = "age_group", value = "count")

# Plot age distribution
ggplot(age_distribution, aes(x = age_group, y = count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', fill = 'cyan') +
  labs(title = 'Age Distribution (All Population)', x = 'Age Group', y = 'Population Count') +
  theme_minimal()
```

This should resolve the issue. The key fix here is using backticks around column names that have special characters. Let me know if this works!




User:
Can you convert these graphs to R markdown?

ChatGPT:
Certainly! Here's how you can structure the code I provided into an R Markdown format. You can use this template to create a report with the three graphs directly in R Markdown.

### R Markdown Template

## Introduction

This report analyzes data from the Toronto shelter system, including trends in the number of actively homeless individuals, housing movements by population group, and the age distribution within the shelter system.

## Load Libraries and Data

We will begin by loading the necessary libraries and the dataset.

```{r load-libraries}
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr) # For gather function
```

```{r load-data}
# Load the CSV data
df <- read.csv('toronto-shelter-system-flow.csv')

# Convert date to proper format using backticks for column name
df$date <- as.Date(paste0('01-', df$`date.mmm.yy`), format = '%d-%b-%y')
```

## 1. Time Series Trend of Actively Homeless

We will plot the number of actively homeless individuals over time for the "All Population" group.

```{r time-series-trend, echo=FALSE, fig.height=6, fig.width=8}
# Filter for 'All Population'
all_population_df <- df %>% filter(population_group == 'All Population')

# Plot actively homeless trend over time
ggplot(all_population_df, aes(x = date, y = actively_homeless)) +
  geom_line(color = 'blue') +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = 'Time Series Trend of Actively Homeless (All Population)',
       x = 'Date', y = 'Actively Homeless Count') +
  theme_minimal()
```

## 2. Moved to Housing by Population Group

This section compares different population groups by the number of individuals moved to housing.

```{r moved-to-housing, echo=FALSE, fig.height=6, fig.width=8}
# Filter out 'All Population' and group by population_group
population_group_df <- df %>% 
  filter(population_group != 'All Population') %>%
  group_by(population_group) %>%
  summarise(moved_to_housing = sum(moved_to_housing, na.rm = TRUE))

# Plot bar graph
ggplot(population_group_df, aes(x = reorder(population_group, -moved_to_housing), y = moved_to_housing)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', fill = 'green') +
  labs(title = 'Moved to Housing by Population Group', 
       x = 'Population Group', y = 'Moved to Housing Count') +
  theme_minimal() +
  coord_flip()
```

## 3. Age Distribution for All Population

We now visualize the age distribution within the shelter system for the "All Population" group.

```{r age-distribution, echo=FALSE, fig.height=6, fig.width=8}
# Summarize age groups for 'All Population'
age_columns <- c('ageunder16', 'age16.24', 'age25.34', 'age35.44', 'age45.54', 'age55.64', 'age65over')
age_distribution <- all_population_df %>%
  summarise(across(all_of(age_columns), sum, na.rm = TRUE))

# Reshape data for plotting
age_distribution <- gather(age_distribution, key = "age_group", value = "count")

# Plot age distribution
ggplot(age_distribution, aes(x = age_group, y = count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', fill = 'cyan') +
  labs(title = 'Age Distribution (All Population)', x = 'Age Group', y = 'Population Count') +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Conclusion

This analysis provides an overview of the shelter system flow, highlighting key trends in homelessness, housing movements, and demographic distribution. Future analyses could include more detailed breakdowns by specific demographic characteristics and temporal changes.

### Instructions to Use:

1. Copy this content into an R Markdown (`.Rmd`) file.
2. Make sure the CSV file (`toronto-shelter-system-flow.csv`) is in the same directory as the `.Rmd` file, or update the path to the CSV file accordingly.
3. You can generate an HTML report by running the R Markdown file in RStudio, or by using the `rmarkdown::render()` function in R.

This template will generate the three graphs in a structured report format, complete with headings and descriptions. Let me know if you need any further adjustments!


User:
will mutate(     date = as_date(Date, format = "%m/%Y")   ) works same as df <- read.csv('toronto-shelter-system-flow.csv')
ChatGPT:

No, the `mutate(date = as_date(Date, format = "%m/%Y"))` function does something different from reading a CSV file using `df <- read.csv('toronto-shelter-system-flow.csv')`. 

Let me explain both of them in detail:

1. **`df <- read.csv('toronto-shelter-system-flow.csv')`**:
   - This is the command to **load the CSV file** into a dataframe (`df`) in R. It reads the data from the CSV file and creates a dataframe, which you can then manipulate.
   - Example:
     ```r
     df <- read.csv('toronto-shelter-system-flow.csv')
     ```
   - After this, you will have a dataframe `df` with the content of the CSV file.

2. **`mutate(date = as_date(Date, format = "%m/%Y"))`**:
   - This is part of the `dplyr` package's **data manipulation function** `mutate()`, which is used to **add or transform columns** in a dataframe.
   - The `as_date(Date, format = "%m/%Y")` portion is used to **convert the column `Date` into a date format**, where the date format is specified as "%m/%Y" (month/year).
   - Example:
     ```r
     library(dplyr)
     df <- df %>%
       mutate(date = as_date(Date, format = "%m/%Y"))
     ```
   - This will create or replace a column named `date` in the dataframe with the properly formatted date, assuming the original column is named `Date`.

### How to use both together:

You would first read the CSV file using `read.csv()` and then, if necessary, use `mutate()` to manipulate or convert the date format. For example:

```r
library(dplyr)

# 1. Load the CSV file
df <- read.csv('toronto-shelter-system-flow.csv')

# 2. Convert the date column (assuming it's called `Date`) into the correct date format
df <- df %>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(paste0('01-', `date.mmm.yy`), format = "%d-%b-%y"))
```

This approach reads the CSV file and then converts the date format correctly.

find some reference article of toronto-shelter-system-flow

ChatGPT:

Toronto's **Shelter System Flow** data provides insights into how people enter and exit the city's shelter system. This data is a critical tool for understanding homelessness trends and targeting interventions to reduce chronic homelessness. The system tracks several key metrics, such as the number of people actively homeless, those moving into permanent housing, and the demographics of the shelter population. 

The **City of Toronto** publishes this data monthly through a public dashboard. It is used to monitor inflow (newly identified individuals and returns from permanent housing) and outflow (people moving to housing or becoming inactive in the system). The data helps assess progress towards making homelessness "rare, brief, and non-recurring." Additionally, demographic filters allow for analysis by specific groups like families, refugees, and Indigenous populations.

This data is part of Toronto's larger **HousingTO Action Plan** and supports the national **Built for Zero** campaign, both of which aim to reduce homelessness. The system has been vital for understanding patterns in shelter use and improving the coordination of resources to address homelessness effectively.

User:
can you draw some more complex graph in R

ChatGPT:

Sure! Here’s an example of a more complex graph in R using multiple layers and additional data manipulations. This example will showcase a **faceted line plot with additional trend lines** for multiple population groups over time, with color coding and smoothing. The graph will show trends in `actively_homeless` over time, with individual trend lines for each population group.

### Example: Faceted Line Plot with Trend Lines

```r
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Load the CSV data
df <- read.csv('toronto-shelter-system-flow.csv')

# Convert date to proper format
df$date <- as.Date(paste0('01-', df$`date.mmm.yy`), format = '%d-%b-%y')

# Filter for relevant columns and exclude 'All Population'
df_filtered <- df %>%
  filter(population_group != 'All Population') %>%
  select(date, population_group, actively_homeless)

# Create a complex line plot with facets by population group and trend lines
ggplot(df_filtered, aes(x = date, y = actively_homeless, color = population_group)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE, linetype = "dashed", size = 1, color = "black") + 
  facet_wrap(~ population_group, scales = "free_y") + 
  labs(title = "Actively Homeless Trends by Population Group",
       x = "Date", y = "Actively Homeless Count",
       color = "Population Group") + 
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") # Hides the legend since facets are clear enough
```

### Explanation:
1. **Facet Wrap**: The `facet_wrap(~ population_group)` command divides the graph into multiple panels, one for each population group, and scales the y-axis independently for each group.
   
2. **Trend Lines**: The `geom_smooth(method = "loess")` adds a smoothed trend line (using LOESS regression) to each panel to show the general trend over time.

3. **Customization**: The `geom_line()` command plots the time series for each group, while setting a consistent theme using `theme_minimal()`.

### Possible Enhancements:
- **Adding Annotations**: You can add vertical lines or text annotations to highlight important events.
- **Custom Color Palette**: Customize the colors using `scale_color_manual()` for better visualization.

Let me know if you'd like to tweak this graph further or if you want me to elaborate on specific aspects!


User: 

more and more plz


ChatGPT:

Here are some more advanced and complex graph examples you can generate in R using the shelter system dataset. Each graph highlights different aspects of the data, such as relationships, distribution, and more. These examples combine multiple layers of visualization.

### 1. **Stacked Area Plot**: Visualizing the distribution of different population groups over time, highlighting changes in the `actively_homeless` population.

```r
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Load the CSV data
df <- read.csv('toronto-shelter-system-flow.csv')

# Convert date to proper format
df$date <- as.Date(paste0('01-', df$`date.mmm.yy`), format = '%d-%b-%y')

# Filter out 'All Population' and select relevant columns
df_filtered <- df %>%
  filter(population_group != 'All Population') %>%
  select(date, population_group, actively_homeless)

# Create a stacked area plot
ggplot(df_filtered, aes(x = date, y = actively_homeless, fill = population_group)) +
  geom_area(position = 'stack') +
  labs(title = 'Stacked Area Plot of Actively Homeless by Population Group',
       x = 'Date', y = 'Actively Homeless Count',
       fill = 'Population Group') +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')
```

### 2. **Heatmap**: Showing the intensity of homelessness among different population groups over time.

```r
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Filter data for heatmap
df_filtered <- df %>%
  filter(population_group != 'All Population') %>%
  select(date, population_group, actively_homeless)

# Create a heatmap
ggplot(df_filtered, aes(x = date, y = population_group, fill = actively_homeless)) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = 'lightblue', high = 'darkblue') +
  labs(title = 'Heatmap of Actively Homeless by Population Group',
       x = 'Date', y = 'Population Group',
       fill = 'Actively Homeless Count') +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

### 3. **Scatter Plot with Regression Lines**: Comparing the relationship between two variables, such as `newly_identified` and `actively_homeless`, with regression lines for each population group.

```r
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Filter and select relevant columns
df_filtered <- df %>%
  filter(population_group != 'All Population') %>%
  select(newly_identified, actively_homeless, population_group)

# Scatter plot with regression line
ggplot(df_filtered, aes(x = newly_identified, y = actively_homeless, color = population_group)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = 'Scatter Plot of Newly Identified vs Actively Homeless',
       x = 'Newly Identified', y = 'Actively Homeless',
       color = 'Population Group') +
  theme_minimal()
```

### 4. **Boxplot**: Showing the distribution of `moved_to_housing` by population group.

```r
# Filter and select relevant columns
df_filtered <- df %>%
  filter(population_group != 'All Population') %>%
  select(population_group, moved_to_housing)

# Boxplot of moved to housing by population group
ggplot(df_filtered, aes(x = population_group, y = moved_to_housing, fill = population_group)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = 'Boxplot of Moved to Housing by Population Group',
       x = 'Population Group', y = 'Moved to Housing Count') +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = 'none', axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

### 5. **Bubble Chart**: Using `actively_homeless` as the size of the bubbles to visually emphasize larger homeless populations.

```r
# Create a bubble chart
ggplot(df_filtered, aes(x = date, y = population_group, size = actively_homeless, color = population_group)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  scale_size(range = c(3, 10)) +
  labs(title = 'Bubble Chart of Actively Homeless by Population Group',
       x = 'Date', y = 'Population Group',
       size = 'Actively Homeless') +
  theme_minimal()
```

### 6. **Violin Plot**: Comparing the distribution of `actively_homeless` across population groups.

```r
# Violin plot of actively homeless by population group
ggplot(df_filtered, aes(x = population_group, y = actively_homeless, fill = population_group)) +
  geom_violin() +
  labs(title = 'Violin Plot of Actively Homeless by Population Group',
       x = 'Population Group', y = 'Actively Homeless Count') +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = 'none', axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

### Explanation of the Graphs:
1. **Stacked Area Plot**: Visualizes the cumulative values of `actively_homeless` by population group over time.
2. **Heatmap**: Displays the intensity or "heat" of homelessness among different population groups over time.
3. **Scatter Plot with Regression**: Shows the relationship between two variables, like `newly_identified` and `actively_homeless`, with a linear trend line for each group.
4. **Boxplot**: Provides insights into the distribution and variability of `moved_to_housing` counts by population group.
5. **Bubble Chart**: A visual representation where the size of the bubbles reflects the `actively_homeless` count for different groups and time periods.
6. **Violin Plot**: Displays the distribution and density of `actively_homeless` counts by population group, similar to a boxplot but with a density curve.

Each of these graphs can reveal different patterns and insights in the shelter system data. Let me know if you’d like to generate these plots, customize them further, or add more complex analyses!

how to change my column name in my data

ChatGPT:

To change column names in your data in R, you can use various functions. Here are some common ways to rename columns:

### 1. **Using `colnames()` Function**
You can directly modify the names of the columns using the `colnames()` function.

```r
# Assuming 'df' is your dataframe
colnames(df)[colnames(df) == 'old_column_name'] <- 'new_column_name'
```

Example:
```r
colnames(df)[colnames(df) == 'ageunder16'] <- 'age_below_16'
```

### 2. **Using `rename()` from `dplyr`**
If you are using the `dplyr` package, the `rename()` function is more intuitive and allows you to rename multiple columns easily.

```r
library(dplyr)

# Renaming columns using rename function
df <- df %>%
  rename(new_column_name = old_column_name)
```

Example:
```r
df <- df %>%
  rename(age_below_16 = ageunder16, age_16_to_24 = age16.24)
```

### 3. **Using `setnames()` from `data.table`**
If your dataframe is a `data.table` object, you can use `setnames()` from the `data.table` package.

```r
library(data.table)

# Set the column name in a data.table
setnames(df, old = "old_column_name", new = "new_column_name")
```

### 4. **Using the Base `names()` Function**
You can also use the `names()` function to rename all columns at once by providing a vector of new column names.

```r
# Renaming all columns at once
names(df) <- c('new_col1', 'new_col2', 'new_col3', 'new_col4')
```

This approach is useful when you want to rename several columns at once.

Let me know if you need further assistance with any specific renaming task!


User:
clean the column names in the data to make it clearer for people to read

ChatGPT:

It seems there was an issue with processing the file. Here's how you can clean the column names manually in R to make them more readable and consistent. This process involves making all names lowercase, replacing spaces with underscores, and removing any special characters like parentheses or dashes.

### R Code to Clean Column Names

```r
# Load necessary library
library(janitor)  # janitor makes it easy to clean column names

# Load your data (replace with your actual file path)
df <- read.csv('toronto-shelter-system-flow.csv')

# Clean the column names to make them clearer
df <- df %>%
  clean_names()  # janitor's function to clean column names

# View the cleaned column names
colnames(df)
```

### Explanation:
- **`clean_names()`** from the `janitor` package automatically:
  - Converts column names to lowercase.
  - Replaces spaces and special characters with underscores.
  - Removes any leading or trailing whitespace.

This method ensures that the column names are cleaner and easier to work with. You can install the `janitor` package in R if you haven't already by running:

```r
install.packages("janitor")
```

simulate this data


ChatGPT:

The dataset has multiple columns capturing various statistics such as population groups, the number of people returning from housing, moved to housing, became inactive, and demographic data (age and gender).

To **simulate** this data, I'll generate a synthetic version that mimics the patterns of the original dataset, while modifying some aspects randomly to simulate variation.

Here's an approach to simulate:

1. Use the same structure for the population groups (`Chronic`, `Refugees`, etc.).
2. Generate random values for numeric columns like `returned_to_shelter`, `actively_homeless`, etc., within realistic ranges based on the observed data.
3. Generate random dates and demographic distributions.

Let’s generate a synthetic version of the data with similar characteristics.

### Simulation Plan:
- Simulate for several population groups over different months.
- Keep numeric values within observed ranges to reflect realistic patterns.

Let me simulate the data for you.

The simulated data has been generated and displayed. It includes various columns like `returned_from_housing`, `newly_identified`, `actively_homeless`, age breakdowns, gender information, and more. The data mimics the structure of the original dataset while introducing random variation.

You can now use this synthetic data for further analysis or visualizations. Let me know if you'd like to generate specific graphs or run further simulations with this data!




User:

show me the r code

ChatGPT:

Here is the R code to simulate a similar dataset as we did in Python. The code generates random values for key columns, keeping the structure of the original dataset.

### R Code for Simulating the Shelter System Data:

```r
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)

# Define the population groups
population_groups <- c("All Population", "Chronic", "Refugees", "Families", "Youth")

# Generate random dates for a few months
dates <- format(seq(ymd("2020-01-01"), by = "month", length.out = 12), "%b-%y")

# Function to simulate numeric columns within reasonable bounds
simulate_column <- function(mean, sd, n) {
  abs(rnorm(n, mean = mean, sd = sd)) %>% round(0)  # Ensure positive values
}

# Create an empty list to store the simulated data
simulated_data <- list()

# Loop through each date and population group to simulate the data
for (date in dates) {
  for (group in population_groups) {
    simulated_data <- append(simulated_data, list(
      data.frame(
        date = date,
        population_group = group,
        returned_from_housing = simulate_column(50, 20, 1),
        returned_to_shelter = simulate_column(500, 100, 1),
        newly_identified = simulate_column(1000, 200, 1),
        moved_to_housing = simulate_column(500, 100, 1),
        became_inactive = simulate_column(800, 150, 1),
        actively_homeless = simulate_column(7000, 1000, 1),
        ageunder16 = simulate_column(1000, 200, 1),
        age16_24 = simulate_column(900, 150, 1),
        age25_34 = simulate_column(1200, 200, 1),
        age35_44 = simulate_column(1300, 200, 1),
        age45_54 = simulate_column(1100, 150, 1),
        age55_64 = simulate_column(600, 100, 1),
        age65over = simulate_column(400, 100, 1),
        gender_male = simulate_column(5000, 1000, 1),
        gender_female = simulate_column(3000, 800, 1),
        gender_transgender_non_binary_two_spirit = simulate_column(100, 30, 1),
        population_group_percentage = paste0(round(runif(1, 20, 100), 1), "%")
      )
    ))
  }
}

# Combine all the simulated data into a single dataframe
simulated_df <- bind_rows(simulated_data)

# View the simulated data
head(simulated_df)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Population Groups**: I defined the main population groups in the dataset.
2. **Dates**: Simulated for 12 months from January to December 2020.
3. **Simulated Columns**: For each `population_group` and `date`, the function `simulate_column` generates random values within a certain range based on realistic assumptions from the original data.
4. **Combine**: All simulated rows are combined into a single dataframe using `bind_rows()`.

### How to Use:
- Run this code in your R environment to generate a synthetic dataset that mimics the structure of the original data.
- Modify the `mean` and `sd` parameters of the `simulate_column` function to better reflect the ranges of your data if necessary.

This R code should produce a clean simulation similar to what was done in Python. Let me know if you need any additional changes!


User:

write some test on the simulate data

ChatGPT:

Here are some example tests you can perform on the simulated data in R to ensure its validity and consistency. These tests will check for certain properties of the data, such as whether the column names are correct, if the data has realistic values, and whether there are any missing values.

### Example R Code for Tests on Simulated Data:

```r
# Load necessary library
library(testthat)

# Check that the data has the expected column names
test_that("column names are correct", {
  expected_columns <- c("date", "population_group", "returned_from_housing", "returned_to_shelter", 
                        "newly_identified", "moved_to_housing", "became_inactive", "actively_homeless",
                        "ageunder16", "age16_24", "age25_34", "age35_44", "age45_54", "age55_64", 
                        "age65over", "gender_male", "gender_female", 
                        "gender_transgender_non_binary_two_spirit", "population_group_percentage")
  
  actual_columns <- colnames(simulated_df)
  expect_equal(actual_columns, expected_columns)
})

# Test that no columns contain negative values (except for percentages, which are strings)
test_that("no negative values in numeric columns", {
  numeric_columns <- simulated_df %>% 
    select(-population_group_percentage, -date, -population_group)
  
  # Check that all values are >= 0
  expect_true(all(numeric_columns >= 0))
})

# Check that there are no missing values (NA) in the data
test_that("no missing values", {
  expect_true(all(complete.cases(simulated_df)))
})

# Test that population_group contains only valid categories
test_that("population_group contains only valid categories", {
  valid_groups <- c("All Population", "Chronic", "Refugees", "Families", "Youth")
  
  # Check that all population groups are in the valid set
  expect_true(all(simulated_df$population_group %in% valid_groups))
})

# Test that date column contains valid date format
test_that("date column has valid date format", {
  expect_true(all(grepl("^[A-Za-z]{3}-\\d{2}$", simulated_df$date)))
})

# Test that percentages are formatted correctly and within bounds
test_that("percentage column is well-formatted and within range", {
  percentages <- simulated_df$population_group_percentage
  
  # Check that all percentages follow the "xx.x%" format and are between 20% and 100%
  expect_true(all(grepl("^\\d{2,3}\\.\\d%$", percentages)))
  expect_true(all(as.numeric(gsub("%", "", percentages)) >= 20 & as.numeric(gsub("%", "", percentages)) <= 100))
})

# Print results if all tests pass
print("All tests passed successfully!")
```

### Explanation of the Tests:
1. **Column Names**: The first test checks whether the columns in the simulated data match the expected column names.
2. **No Negative Values**: This test ensures that no numeric columns have negative values, which would be unrealistic for this dataset.
3. **No Missing Values**: Ensures there are no `NA` values in the simulated data.
4. **Valid Population Groups**: This test verifies that the `population_group` column contains only the predefined groups.
5. **Date Format**: Ensures that the `date` column has the correct format (`MMM-YY`, e.g., Jan-20).
6. **Percentage Format and Range**: This test ensures that the `population_group_percentage` is properly formatted as a percentage (e.g., "68.9%") and that it falls within the expected range of 20% to 100%.

### How to Use:
- Run this code after generating your simulated dataset in R.
- If any test fails, `testthat` will report which test did not pass, allowing you to debug or adjust the simulation as needed.

Let me know if you need further assistance or more advanced testing examples!


User:

do not use test that


ChatGPT:

Here’s how you can manually test the simulated data in R without using the `testthat` package. This code will perform the same checks and print messages indicating whether each test has passed or failed.

### Manual Testing of Simulated Data:

```r
# 1. Check that the column names are correct
expected_columns <- c("date", "population_group", "returned_from_housing", "returned_to_shelter", 
                      "newly_identified", "moved_to_housing", "became_inactive", "actively_homeless",
                      "ageunder16", "age16_24", "age25_34", "age35_44", "age45_54", "age55_64", 
                      "age65over", "gender_male", "gender_female", 
                      "gender_transgender_non_binary_two_spirit", "population_group_percentage")

actual_columns <- colnames(simulated_df)
if (all(actual_columns == expected_columns)) {
  print("Test Passed: Column names are correct.")
} else {
  print("Test Failed: Column names do not match the expected ones.")
}

# 2. Test that no negative values exist in numeric columns (except percentages)
numeric_columns <- simulated_df %>% 
  select(-population_group_percentage, -date, -population_group)

if (all(numeric_columns >= 0)) {
  print("Test Passed: No negative values in numeric columns.")
} else {
  print("Test Failed: Negative values found in numeric columns.")
}

# 3. Check that there are no missing values (NA) in the data
if (all(complete.cases(simulated_df))) {
  print("Test Passed: No missing values in the data.")
} else {
  print("Test Failed: Missing values found in the data.")
}

# 4. Test that population_group contains only valid categories
valid_groups <- c("All Population", "Chronic", "Refugees", "Families", "Youth")

if (all(simulated_df$population_group %in% valid_groups)) {
  print("Test Passed: All population groups are valid.")
} else {
  print("Test Failed: Invalid population groups found.")
}

# 5. Test that date column contains valid date format (MMM-YY)
if (all(grepl("^[A-Za-z]{3}-\\d{2}$", simulated_df$date))) {
  print("Test Passed: Date column has the correct format (MMM-YY).")
} else {
  print("Test Failed: Date column has an incorrect format.")
}

# 6. Test that percentages are well-formatted and within bounds
percentages <- simulated_df$population_group_percentage
percentage_numeric <- as.numeric(gsub("%", "", percentages))

if (all(grepl("^\\d{2,3}\\.\\d%$", percentages)) && all(percentage_numeric >= 20 & percentage_numeric <= 100)) {
  print("Test Passed: Percentages are formatted correctly and within the valid range (20% - 100%).")
} else {
  print("Test Failed: Invalid percentage format or out-of-range values.")
}

# If all tests pass
print("Manual testing completed.")
```

### Explanation of the Manual Tests:
1. **Column Names**: Checks whether the actual column names match the expected ones.
2. **No Negative Values**: Ensures that all numeric values are non-negative (except for the percentage column, which is excluded).
3. **No Missing Values**: Verifies that the dataset contains no missing values.
4. **Valid Population Groups**: Ensures the `population_group` column contains only valid categories.
5. **Date Format**: Ensures the `date` column follows the correct format (`MMM-YY`).
6. **Percentage Format**: Checks that percentage values are formatted correctly (e.g., `xx.x%`) and are within the range of 20% to 100%.

### How to Use:
- You can copy this code into your R environment after generating the simulated dataset.
- It will print a message for each test, indicating whether it passed or failed.
- If any test fails, you can debug the issue based on the feedback.

Let me know if you need further customizations or additional tests!

Caused by error:! object 'actively_homeless' not found

ChatGPT:

It looks like the error is occurring because the column `actively_homeless` may not exist in the dataframe, either due to a typo or a mismatch in column names.

### Solution:
You can check the column names of your dataframe to ensure the column exists and is named correctly. Here's a step-by-step approach to resolve the issue:

1. **Check the column names**:
   Run the following code to see the exact names of the columns in the dataframe.

   ```r
   # Check column names
   colnames(simulated_df)
   ```

2. **Confirm the correct column name**:
   Once you have the list of column names, ensure that you're using the exact name of the column. Column names are case-sensitive in R.

3. **Fix the column reference**:
   If the column name is different (e.g., it's called `actively_homeless_` or another variation), update your code to use the correct name.

### Example:
If the actual column name differs slightly (e.g., `actively_homeless_`), modify your code like this:

```r
# Correct the column name
numeric_columns <- simulated_df %>% 
  select(-population_group_percentage, -date, -population_group)

# Print column names
print(colnames(numeric_columns))

# Ensure the right columns are checked for negative values
if (all(numeric_columns >= 0)) {
  print("Test Passed: No negative values in numeric columns.")
} else {
  print("Test Failed: Negative values found in numeric columns.")
}
```

If the column `actively_homeless` doesn't exist and should be created, you can add it like this:

```r
# Create the actively_homeless column if it doesn't exist
if (!"actively_homeless" %in% colnames(simulated_df)) {
  simulated_df$actively_homeless <- simulate_column(7000, 1000, nrow(simulated_df))
}
```

Let me know if this resolves the issue or if you need further clarification!



User:

Error in df %>% filter(population_group != "All Population") %>% select(date,  :   could not find function "%>%"


ChatGPT:

The error you're seeing occurs because the pipe operator (`%>%`) from the **`dplyr`** package is not recognized. This usually happens if the **`dplyr`** package (or the **`tidyverse`** package, which includes `dplyr`) is not loaded.

### Solution:
You need to make sure that **`dplyr`** is installed and loaded before using the pipe operator (`%>%`).

1. **Install `dplyr` (if not already installed)**:

   ```r
   install.packages("dplyr")
   ```

2. **Load the `dplyr` package**:

   ```r
   library(dplyr)
   ```

3. **Run the code again**:
   After loading the package, your code should work as expected. Here’s how you can rewrite the section that was causing the issue:

   ```r
   library(dplyr)  # Make sure the dplyr package is loaded

   # Filter and select relevant columns
   df_filtered <- simulated_df %>% 
     filter(population_group != "All Population") %>%
     select(date, population_group, actively_homeless)

   # Print the filtered data
   head(df_filtered)
   ```

### Alternative (without `%>%` operator):
If you'd like to avoid using the pipe operator, you can use regular function calls instead. Here's how to rewrite the same logic without `%>%`:

```r
# Without using %>%
df_filtered <- select(filter(simulated_df, population_group != "All Population"), 
                      date, population_group, actively_homeless)

# Print the filtered data
head(df_filtered)
```

Let me know if this resolves your issue!
